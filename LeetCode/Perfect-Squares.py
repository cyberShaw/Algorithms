Lagrange's 4 square and 3 square theorem

Theorem: Every natural number can be represented as the sum of 4 integer squares.
N = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2

Theorem: A natural number can be represented as sum of 3 squares of integers.
N = a^2 + b^2 + c^2

if and only if the N is not of the form,

N = 4^a (8b + 7) -- (1)

LOGIC: 
- if N is a perfect square, return 1
- if N is of form (1),
    - keep dividing by 4
    - divide by 8
        - if rem == 7:
            return 4
- check if N can be split into two perfect squares. If yes, return 2
- if all fails, return 3
